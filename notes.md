# Chapter Two: Creating a Guessing Game

- An associated function a function that is implemented on a type.

Example:

```rust
let mut guess = String::new();
```

`new()` is an associated function on the string type ans `::` is used to access it.

In Rust, we have crates. They're like third-party packages that add more functionality to our application.

There are *Binary* crates and *library crates*. Binary crates are mostly executables like the project we are building in this charger. Whereas, Library crates contains code that is intended to be used in other programs and can't be executed on its own.

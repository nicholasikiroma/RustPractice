## Installation

One of the easiest ways to setup Rust locally is to use `Rustup`. A CLI tool which allows developers to easily manage Rust installation and associated packges. Think `NVM` for NodeJS.

Command for installing Rustup:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh'
```
